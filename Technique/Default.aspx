                        The technique of playing the game Carom contains several elements:
                        <ol>

                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            On this page I'm not going to deal with all the elements of this game. Let me first explain 
                            some basic elements important for playing the game successfully. This is primarily: <br />
                            1. Strike or Break, 2. Types of strokes (shots), 3. Aiming                             
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            STRIKE OR BREAK<br />
                            Strike or Break is the first stroke in Carrom, performed by the player who plays with white 
                            Carrommen. After that, the Carrommen from the initial positioning "spread" across the surface 
                            of the Carrom Board (if of course Break is sufficiently precise and powerful). In the game 
                            of individuals, it is recommended to play the Reverse Strike or Circular Strike. In the game 
                            of pairs a Straight Strike may also be played. If the Break by the player is carried out 
                            correctly, it allows the player to play the next shot easily, since the position of his 
                            Carrommen is better (easier to hit the hole) and his opponent's harder (harder to hit in 
                            the hole). Break must be carried out with a reasonable power and with an appropriate angle 
                            regarding the initial positioning of Carrommen in the middle - centre circle. If the Break 
                            is carried out properly, the player usually has the possibility of sinking at least 4 (four) 
                            Carrommen easily into the holes.                                                        
                        </p>
